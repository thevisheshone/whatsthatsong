I turn the light on, and see your pretty face
I turn the light off, wishing that I could free space
I turn away, and know you're never far away from me
So I stay for another day

If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you
No matter what day, I'm coming right back to you
If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you
No matter what they say, I'm coming right back to you

I learn to run off so I can keep the pace
And never a moment goes by I wouldn't trade for your embrace
Skies of gray, I know you're never far away from me
And I stay for another day

If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you
No matter what day, I'm coming right back to you
If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you
No matter what they say, I'm coming right back to you

Won't you stay with me?
Won't you stay with me?

If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you
No matter what day, I'm coming right back to you
If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you
No matter what they say, I'm coming right back to you

If there's a way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you
No matter what day, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you
No matter which way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you
If there's a way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you

If there's a way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you
No matter what day, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you
No matter which way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you
If there's a way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you
