You're the one for me
Go the depth for me
All you gotta do is reach out with your arms
Even though the sky is painted black with night
It will guide you to the road back to me

You're the one for me
Go the depth for me
All you gotta do is reach out with your arms
Even though the sky is painted black with night
It will guide you to the road back to me

It will guide you to the road back to me

Have you ever felt something so real?
Like we should explore and not sit still
Go ahead and reach out

You're the one for me
Go the depth for me
All you gotta do is reach out with your arms
Even though the sky is painted black with night
It will guide you to the road back to me

You're the one for me
Go the depth for me
All you gotta do is reach out with your arms
Even though the sky is painted black with night
It will guide you to the road back to me

It will guide you to the road back to me
