Talk about about love
And talk about trust
I know it's hard to believe this is us

Talk about hate
Talk about distrust
Tell me every time this has to be discussed

Go tell your mother
And your father too
Go tell your brothers, I think your sister knew

How will we know
When you are done and I am undone?
(I am undone) (how will we know?)

Lay one more time
On this blood stained sheet
The soft ground is where our hearts would meet

Tied and tangled
By everything we've done
Just lie still and we can wait for the sun

How will we know (how will we know?)
When you are done and I am undone?

How will we know (how will we know?)
When you are done and I am undone?

Again and again I come back...
Again and again I...

Again and again I come back
Again and again I come back
Again and again I come back
Again and again I come back

Again and again I come back!
Again and again I come back!
Again and again I come back!

How will we know
When you are done and I am undone?

How will we know
When you are done and I am undone?

How will we know
When you are done and I am undone?
