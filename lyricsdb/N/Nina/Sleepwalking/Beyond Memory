Take it
I surrender the attack
Nevermind the killing
Dazed and numb, stripped to the core
Our moment was stolen
Time has won
Wounded souls
Our moment was stolen
Time has won

Beyond memory
Faces I see
Mean nothing to me
Only shadows in my dreams
Beyond memory
Why is it me?
And no one can see?
Only shadows in my dreams

Fake it
I surrender to the fight
I can see the darkness in your eyes
Down to the bone
Your victim was chosen
Time has won
All along
Your victim was chosen
Time has won

Beyond memory
Faces I see
Mean nothing to me
Only shadows in my dreams
Beyond memory
Why is it me?
And no one can see?
Only shadows in my dreams

Paint me, with your colours
And your love
Nevermind the killing

Beyond memory
Faces I see
Mean nothing to me
Only shadows in my dreams
Beyond memory
Why is it me?
And no one can see?
Only shadows in my dreams

Only shadows in my dreams...

Only shadows in my dreams...

Only shadows in my dreams
