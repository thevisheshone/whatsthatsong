Turning back, turning back
To my special place
Give it up, give it up
All the fears we share

Turning back, turning back
To my special place
Give it up, give it up
All the fears we share
And I just don't care
All the fears we share
And I just don't care

Bring it up, bring it up
Don't take me down
Bring it up, bring it up
Bring it up, bring it up
Bring it up, bring it up
Bring it up, bring it up
Bring it up, bring it up
Bring it up, bring it up
Bring it up, bring it up
Bring it up, bring it up
Bring it up, bring it up

Turning back, turning back
To my special place
Give it up, give it up
All the fears we share

Turning back, turning back
To my special place
Give it up, give it up
All the fears we share
And I just don't care
All the fears we share
And I just don't care
All the fears we share
And I just don't care
All the fears we share
And I just don't care
