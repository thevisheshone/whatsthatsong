Rain and fire crossed that ocean
Another mad man done struck again
Rain and fire crossed that ocean
Another mad man done struck again

Sitting down here fallout shelter
Paint my walls, twice a week
Sitting down here fallout shelter
Think about the slaves, long time ago

Ten million slaves crossed that Ocean
They had shackles on Their Legs
Ten million slaves crossed that Ocean
They had Shackles on Their Legs

Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been
Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been

Sun goes out, you'll be standing
You'll be standing by yourself
Sun goes out, you'll be standing
You'll be standing by yourself

Ten million slaves crossed that Ocean
They Had Shackles on their legs
Ten million slaves crossed that Ocean
They had shackles on their legs

Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been
Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been

Ten million slaves crossed that ocean
They had shackles on their legs
Food goes bad, food looks rancid
But they ate it anyway

Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been
Don't know where, where they're going
Don't know where, where they've been

Sun goes out, you'll be standing
You'll be standing all alone
Sun goes out, you'll be standing
You'll be standing all alone

All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone
