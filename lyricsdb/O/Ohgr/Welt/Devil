Sick I've lit the bridge on fire
Exposed the nerves will twitch
Feed the needy x desire
Poke it with a stick

I need assertion
Devils in my eye won't let up any motion
I need a surgeon
Devils inside won't cut me any slack

I need assertion
Devils in my eye won't let up any motion
I need a surgeon
Devils inside won't cut me any slack

Who cares about you?
I thought I did
Who cares about you?

Fingers twitch and blisters stalk her
Removes itself from it
Dream the greedy motivators
Sleep it off again

I need assertion
Devils in my eye won't let up any motion
I need a surgeon
Devils inside won't cut me any slack

I need assertion
Devils in my eye won't let up any motion
I need a surgeon
Devils inside won't cut me any slack

Who cares about you?
I thought I did
Who cares about you?

I need assertion
Devils in my eye won't let up any motion
I need a surgeon
Devils inside won't cut me any slack

I need assertion
Devils in my eye won't let up any motion
I need a surgeon
Devils inside won't cut me any slack

Distant wreaths surreal retired
In bed forever sleeps
Secrets feed the next desire
Desires not to be

I need assertion
Devils in my eye won't let up any motion
I need a surgeon
Devils inside won't cut me any slack

I need assertion
Devils in my eye won't let up any motion
I need a surgeon
Devils inside won't cut me any slack

Who cares about you?
I thought I did
Who cares about you?

Who cares about you?
I thought I did
Who cares about you?

Who cares about you?
I thought I did
Who cares about you?
