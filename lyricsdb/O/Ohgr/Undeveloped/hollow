Instant paper compromise
Audience still survives
Underneath the bloody cape
Audience still escapes

Feeling torture on the page
Audience comes of age
Fucking donkeys, right diseased
Bleeding years, never pleased

The eyes can't protect you through
The compromising eye
Swore allegiance to
The light

Wicked paper aspirates
Audience fearing hate
Over top what's underneath
Audience is in defeat

Free to worry, keep the peace
Audience in disgrace
Someone's knocking on their knees
All he says, "Can't release"

The eyes will protect you through
The compromising eye
Swore allegiance to
The lie

The flies, self-protection proves
The compost-smelling piles
To pass on over to
Our future

Hollow…
Hollow…

Hollow…
Sliding deep in it
Hollow…
Something's full of shit
Hollow…
Each and every bit
Hollow…
Something smells like shit

Hollow…
