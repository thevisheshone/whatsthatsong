What can I say?
When every word you won't believe anyway
No promise made
Just means there's nothing wrong today

What can I do?
Cause I could never make things up to you
And we both new
That if things don't change it'll all be thrown away

Don't break my fall
(Cause things look better from down here)
To lose it all
(Just means there's another chance for you to)
Gain it back again
And maybe even have a laugh, my friend

What can I hide?
When every feeling's locked down deep inside
My hands are tied
But I'm hangin' on
And I'm hangin' in

Don't break my fall
(Cause things look better from down here)
To lose it all
(Just means there's another chance for you to)
Gain it back again
And maybe even have a laugh, my friend

Sure do like the sound of it
Sure do like the sound of it

Don't break my fall
Don't break my

Don't break my fall
(Cause things look better from down here)
To lose it all
(Just means there's another chance for you to)
Gain it back again
And maybe even have a laugh, my friend

Don't break my fall, don't break my fall
Don't break my fall
Don't break my
Don't break my
Don't break my fall
