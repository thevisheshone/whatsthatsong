Your face is burned inside my brain
(I lost my way)
Your taste of stale flows through my veins
(The cost of hate)

Cause you'll never understand me

You want me to stay

You're c-c-c-calling but I can't hear you
I'm not listening anymore
You're subject to falling but I can't save you
I don't see you anymore

The race of slowing down the pain
(I found a way)
The pace of speaking so mundane
(The sound of gain)

But you'll never make me happy

So I've extinguished the flame

You're c-c-c-calling, but I can't hear you
I'm not listening anymore
You're subject to falling, but I can't save you
I don't see you anymore

And what you want me to say I'll never say
You're playing the game that I'll never play

So what do you want from me?

Now I've extinguished the flame

Your c-c-c-calling but I can't hear you
I'm not listening anymore
You're subject to falling but I can't save you
I don't see you anymore

You're c-c-c-calling but I can't hear you,
I'm not listening anymore
You're f-f-f-falling, but I can't save you
I don't see you anymore
