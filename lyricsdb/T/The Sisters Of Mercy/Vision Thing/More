Some people get by
With a little understanding
Some people get by
With a whole lot more

Oh, I don't know
Why you gotta be so undemanding
One thing I know:
I want more... I want more!

(And I need all the love that I can't get, too)
(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get, too)

D'you get scared to feel so much?
To let somebody touch you?
So hot, so cold, so far, so out of control
When hard to come by, the harder to hold

Some people get by
With a little understanding
Some people get by
With a whole lot more

I don't know
Why you gotta be so undemanding...
I want more!

(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get, too)
(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get, too)

There are parts of me that don't get nervous --
Not the parts that shake
You won't get what you deserve,
You are what you take

Learning to cry for fun and profit,
I'm not done yet
Counterfeit dollars or the English zloty,
Anything I can get

Some people get by
With a little understanding
Some people get by
With a whole lot more

Oh, I don't know
Why you gotta be so undemanding
One thing I know:
I want more!

(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get, too)
(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get, too)

(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get, too)
(And I need all the love I can get)
All the love that you can get
(And I need all the love that I can't get, too)
All the love that I can't get, too...

(And I need all the love I can get)
All the love that you can get
(And I need all the love that I can't get, too)
All the love that I can't get too...

(And I need all the love I can get)
All the love, all the love
(And I need all the love that I can't get, too)
All the love that I can't get too...

(And I need all the love I can get)
All the love that you can get
(And I need all the love that I can't get, too)
That I can't get, too...

And I need!
(And I need all the love I can get)
All the love that you can get
(And I need all the love that I can't get, too)
That I can't get, too!

And I need
All the love...
That you can't get!
