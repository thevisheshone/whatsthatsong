(I'm not dead yet)

Now you take a new turn
Let the old burn
Transform what you once were
Into a berserk

Resurrection, breathe crisp air
Not crippled with fear
Rebirth, open your eyes
Come into life

(I'm not dead yet)

Refreshed you dare a new start
Submission's no brave thing, you would not give in
You re-animated machine,
With muscles, and wit, and nerves extreme

(I'm not dead yet)

Run and hide
Face what you think must be faced, in the end you'll
Run and hide
Flee from the menace you have aroused, for it is powerful

So, you're an energy pack
Strong and young, you should never be wrecked
There ain't no challenge too big for you
In your limbs the fire burns, burns, burns

But no way you'll win, no matter how you try
Against powers older than life
You'll get nowhere but back
With your one-dimensional superhero attitude

(I'm not dead yet)

Run and hide
Fight what you think must be fought, in the end you'll
Run and hide
Duck in the dirt, in a hole, in the ground, go!
Run and hide
Run to be safe, to be whole, to be free
Run and hide
Don't try to fight, try to flee, try to live by

(I'm not dead yet)

Run, you berserk of sensitive skin
Are you ready to fail?
You've got forty seconds, then:
Better be off, for we are fed up
With your making noise
You are nothing but something to be swept off
You overestimate yourself
You are bold but a mortal fly
You are strong, strong, strong
But alone you must strive

(I'm not dead yet)

Run and hide
Do what you think must be done, in the end you'll
Run and hide
Run, save your head, save your life, save your breath, go!
Run and hide
Don't try to fight, try to flee, try to live by
Run and hide
Seek shelter before it's too late
Run and hide
Fight what you think must be fought, in the end you'll
Run and hide
Run to be safe, to be whole!

Oh, it's kind of different, trancer
