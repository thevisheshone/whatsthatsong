Letting out the truth
I'm about to lose
Letting out the truth
I'm about to lose
I'm about to lose
I'm about to lose

I will get lost
Will get lost
I will get lost
Will get lost

Man on the run surrenders
Giving up the fight once more
Those who are disunited
Cannot scratch the itchy spot, the psyche sore

Help me out, my psyche really aches
Notion leading me astray
Will you help me letting out the truth?
I'm about to lose

Watching my face worn out with guilt
I couldn't make out myself no more
I've let the itchy spot grow large
Entangled with what I've done before
I broke up my life, and theirs

Help me out, my psyche really aches
Notion leading me astray
Will you help me letting out the truth?
I'm about to lose

Letting out the truth
I'm about to lose

Letting out the truth
I'm about to lose
