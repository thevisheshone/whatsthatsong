Living can be easy
On something you can trust
The more you watch, the less you know
Let your worries be our task
A new world breaks
And we've got what it takes

Cyberbite, you tricky liar
Contorted truth
Casting system with televictims
Whose heads are being filled with ooze
Mindless willing tools

Cyberbite stole my soul
Cyberbite stole my soul
Cyberbite stole my soul

Cyberbyte, the system
Creeping in control
Random is resistance
And freedom is the goal
Cyberbyte
Cyberbyte

Cyberbyte, the system
Creeping in control
Random is resistance
And freedom is the goal
Cyberbyte
Cyberbyte

Televicious soma
Media in control
Filling empty eyes
Flooding emptied minds
Who failed the trial

Giving up the ego
They're crawling to the beast
Cyberbite, the new religion
Shaping us to its mould
It's time to counteract
Cyberbite, the system

Cyberbite stole my soul
Cyberbite stole my soul
Cyberbite stole my soul

Cyberbyte, the system
Creeping in control
Random is resistance
Freedom is the goal
Cyberbyte
Cyberbyte

Cyberbyte, the system
Creeping in control
Random is resistance
Freedom is the goal
Cyberbyte
Cyberbyte

Cyberbyte, the system
Creeping in control
Random is resistance
Freedom is the goal
Cyberbyte
