I don't know what you're looking for
You haven't found it baby, that's for sure
You rip me up, you spread me all around
In the dust of the deed of time

And this is no case of lust you see
It's not a matter of you versus me
It's fine the way you want me on your own
But in the end it's always me alone

I'm losing my favourite game,
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my baby,
Losing my favourite game

I only know what I've been working for
Another you so I could love you more
I really thought that I could take you there
But my experiment is not getting us anywhere

I had a vision I could turn you right
A stupid mission in a lethal fight
I should have seen it when my hope was new
My heart is black and my body is blue

And I'm losing my favourite game,
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my favourite game,
You're losing your mind again
I'm losing my baby,
Losing my favourite game

I'm losing my favourite game (losing my favourite)
You're losing your mind again (I try)
I try but you're still the same (I try)
I'm losing my baby, you're losing a saviour and a saint
