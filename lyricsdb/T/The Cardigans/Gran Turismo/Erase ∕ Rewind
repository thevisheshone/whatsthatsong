Hey, what did you hear me say?
You know the difference it makes.
What did you hear me say?

Yes, I said it's fine before,
But I don't think so no more.
I said it's fine before.

I've changed my mind,
I take it back.
Erase and rewind, 'cause I've been changing my mind.
Erase and rewind, 'cause I've been changing my mind.
I've changed my mind.

So, where did you see me go?
It's not the right way, you know.
Where did you see me go?

No, it's not that I don't know.
I just don't want it to grow.
It's not that I don't know.

I've changed my mind,
I take it back.
Erase and rewind, 'cause I've been changing my mind.
Erase and rewind, 'cause I've been changing my mind.
Erase and rewind, 'cause I've been changing my mind.
Erase and rewind, 'cause I've been changing my mind.
Erase and rewind...
Erase and rewind...
I've changed my mind.
