I know we're hurtin'
And we might have seen it all
We're building walls
And we love to see them fall
We learn to walk
But the spirit in us crawls…

It's all been written
It's all been sung
We cannot hide
What's been comin' all along
And after all that's lost
There ain't no right or wrong

Someway, some place
I don't know where
But I'm goin' there with you
Someway, somehow
I don't know where
But I'm goin' there with you
I'll make it there with you
We will reign (na na na)
We will reign (na na na)

We're always sayin'
That it's always almost over
Why does it take a war
To bring us closer
And love is true
When the times are gettin' colder

Someway, some place
I don't know where
But I'm goin' there with you
Someway, somehow
I don't know where
But I'm goin' there with you
I'll make it there with you
I'll be there with you
We will reign

Na na na…

Someway, some place
I don't know where
But I'm goin' there with you
Someway, somehow
I don't know where
But I'm goin' there with you
I'll make it there with you

We will reign (na na na…)
We will reign (na na na…)
We will reign (na na na…)
We will reign (na na na…)
We will reign (na na na…)
