You walk around
With your head in the ground
You talkin' loud
But don't make a sound
Ya can't speak to power
In the killing fields

You think that flower power
Will make them stop
Bang! bang! bang! baby
Here come the cops
Power is power, love
No matter who's on top

Hush now, baby
You're in the killing fields

They want me to toe
The party line
But they ain't got the tools
And I ain't got the time
They'll take all your money
And leave your children behind

You think that flower power
Will make them stop
Bang! bang! bang! baby
Here come the cops
Power is power, love
No matter who's on top

Hush now, baby
You're in the killing fields

Now listen, baby
Cuz I know it's hard
It could be Gandhi
Or the son of God
Love, power is power
No matter who's on top

You think that flower power
Will make them stop
Bang! bang! bang! baby
Here come the cops
Power is power, love
No matter who's on top

Hush now, baby
You're in the killing fields

Hush now, baby
You're in the killing fields
