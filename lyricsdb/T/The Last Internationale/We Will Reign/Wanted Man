I've been fighting
For so long
In the shit
It is my home
And I've been killing
Whether right or wrong

Between two sides
I'm drawn and owned
And a God
That has left me alone
I am no one
And I'll die unknown

Don't try to find me
Don't worry where I am
Or you will wind up
Another wanted man

Wanted man
You'll be a wanted man
You will run
And you'll die
A wanted man

Hoo hoo
Hoo hoo
Hoo hoo
Hoo hoo

The road behind
Has disappeared
Drowned in the memories
Of your tears
And your shadow
But it's still too near

No one to trust
Or truths to speak
I am the enemy
That I fear
Lord forgive me
When the smoke clears

Don't try to find me
Don't worry where I am
Or you will wind up
Another wanted man

Wanted man
You'll be a wanted man
You will run
And you'll die
A wanted man

Wanted man
You'll be a wanted man
You will run
And you'll die
A wanted man

Hoo hoo
Hoo hoo
Hoo hoo
Hoo hoo

Don't try to find me
Don't worry where I am
Or you will wind up
Another wanted man

Wanted man
You'll be a wanted man
Yeah, you will run
And you'll die
A wanted man

Wanted man (hoo hoo)
A wanted man (hoo hoo)
Yeah, you will run (hoo hoo)
And you'll die
A wanted man (hoo hoo)

Wanted man (hoo hoo)
A wanted man (hoo hoo)
Yeah, you will run (hoo hoo)
And you'll die
A wanted man

I've been fighting
For so long
In the shit
It is my home
And I've been killing
Whether right or wrong
