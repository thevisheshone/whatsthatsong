My compassion is broken now
My will is eroded now
And my desire is broken now
And it makes me feel ugly

I'm on my knees and burning
My piss and moans are the fuel
That set my head on fire
So smell my soul is burning

I'm broken, looking up to see the enemy
And I have swallowed the poison you feed me
But I survive on the poisons you feed me
And leavin' guilt fed, hatred fed, weakness fed
And it makes me feel ugly

I'm on my knees and burning
My piss and moans are the fuel
That set my head on fire
I'm dead inside

Shit adds up
Shit adds up
Shit adds up
Shit adds up at the bottom

(If I let you, you would make me destroy myself)
(In order to survive you, I must first survive myself)
(I can sink no further, and I cannot forgive you)

(There's no choice but to confront you, to engage you, to erase you)
(I've gone to great lengths to expand my threshold of pain)
(I will use my mistakes against you, there's no other choice)
(I'm shameless now, I'm nameless now, I'm nothing now, I'm no one now)
(But my soul must be iron 'cause my fear is naked)
(I'm naked and fearless, and my fear is naked)

Dead inside, dead inside
Dead inside, dead inside
Nameless now, shameless now
Nothing now, no one now

Shit adds up
Shit adds up
Shit adds up
Shit adds up
As you see me naked now
Fearless now, naked now
Fearless now

Shit adds up
Shit adds up
Shit adds up
Shit adds up
It leaves me dead inside
Dead inside, dead inside, dead inside

Hatred keeps me alive
Lowliness keeps me alive
Weakness keeps me alive
Guilt keeps me alive at the bottom
