What's coming through is alive
What's holding up is a mirror
But what's singing songs is a snake
Looking to turn my piss to wine

They're both totally void of hate
But killing me just the same

The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again

And I feel this coming over like a storm again
Considerately

Venomous voice, tempts me
Drains me, bleeds me
Leaves me cracked and empty
Drags me down like some sweet gravity

The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again

And I feel this coming over like a storm again now
And I feel this coming over like a storm again now

I am too connected to you to
Slip away, fade away
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me

Considerately killing me
Considerately killing me
Considerately killing me
Considerately killing me

Without the skin here
Beneath the storm
Under these tears now
The walls came down

And as the snake is drowned
And as I look in his eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of those times

I could have cried then
I should have cried then

And as the walls come down
And as I look in your eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times
I have died
And will die
It's all right
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind

I am too connected to you
Slip away, fade away
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me
Considerately killing me
Considerately killing me and
Considerately killing me
