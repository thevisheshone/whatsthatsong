Say "ah"
Say "ah"

It's no secret we're close
As sweaty velcro,
Like latex, fur and feathers
Stuck together

Now.

In their '62 'vette
Sharing one cigarette,
In a black light trance then
Go go dance

Then.

Go go trance

Then...

They keep me warm on cold nights
We must be quite a sight,
In our meat triangle
All tangled

Wow

My girlfriend's girlfriend
She looks like you
My girlfriend's girlfriend
She's my girl too

Her and me and her and she and me
An uncrowded couple,
Are we three?

Hey, we don't care what people say,
When walking hand in hand down Kings Highway
Two for one today

My girlfriend's girlfriend
She looks like you
My girlfriend's girlfriend
She's my girl too

My girlfriend's girlfriend
She looks like you
My girlfriend's girlfriend
She's my girl...
