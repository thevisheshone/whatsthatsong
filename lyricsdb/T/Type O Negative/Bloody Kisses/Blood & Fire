No more nights of blood and fire
No more nights of blood and fire

Yeah I always thought we'd be together
And that our love could not be better
Well, with no warning you were gone
I still don't know what went wrong

(You don't know what I've been through)
(Just want to put my love in you)

No more nights of blood and fire
No more nights of blood and fire

All those special memories
Now I bleed for you - burn for me
Perhaps I was just dreaming
When I think these things had real meaning

(You don't know what I've been through)
(Just want to put my love in you)

Love eternal
Lust infernal
Bleeding, burning
Needing, yearning

Ma ch√©ri, you remain a mystery to me
I see your face in every flame
With no answers, I have only myself to blame
Of all the women that I have known - they're not you
I'd rather be alone

No more nights of blood and fire
No more nights of blood and fire

No more nights of blood
No more nights of fire!
