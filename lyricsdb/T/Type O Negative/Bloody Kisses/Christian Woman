Forgive her for she knows not what she does

A cross upon her bedroom wall
From grace she will fall
An image burning in her mind
And between her thighs

A dying god-man full of pain
When will you cum again?
Before him beg to serve or please
On your back or knees

No forgiveness for her sins
Prefers punishment
Would you suffer eternally
Or internally?

Ah

For her lust she'll burn in hell
Her soul done medium well
All through mass manual stimulation
Salvation

Corpus Christi
(she needs)
Corpus Christi
Corpus Christi

Corpus Christi
(she needs)
Corpus Christi
Corpus Christi

Body of Christ
(she needs)
Body of Christ
Body of Christ
