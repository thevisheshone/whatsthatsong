You are my newest friend
There is nothing to pretend
My arms do keep you warm
My body keeps you calm

You are my little love
My half is your half
Every minute I am away
I always like to stay

I give you all my love
It's you that makes me cry

It's you
It's you I'm living for
It's you
It's you I'm singing for

It's you
It's you that makes me grow
It's you
It's you that I will know

It's you...
(you)
