Looking now with new sight, new sight to see it all.
A void with the cruelest intentions.
Why aren't we taking what is ours?
Hours of time and devotion.

Time is of the essence.
Let us hold it close.
Let us hold it close.
Let us hold it close.
Let us hold it close.
Let us hold it close.
Let us hold it close.

It's time to go back to places where we found ourselves,
Alive and full, knowing it was in us all along.

It was in me,
It was in us all along.
It was in me,
It was in us all along.
It was in me.

I can't scream enough to hold your attention.
Betrayed.
How many more will fall to the false image you portray.
Open your heart.
Open your heart.

Cause at the end of the day,
Your ardent love keeps me safe.
At the end of the day
Your ardent love keeps us safe from falling away,
Away.
