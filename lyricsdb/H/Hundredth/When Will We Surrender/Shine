We are tattered men.
Nothing but mirrors of the walls we've built.
I've built a high gate and I've invited destruction.
Bruised and broken by my self-righteousness.
I can't go without letting my self down.
I can't go without letting my self down.

We, we cannot win alone.
We're coming up dry, our necks flush.
We've been staring at our crowns.
We've abandoned something up above, something up above.

I am nothing without the men who walked before me.
I'm broken by my own pride, my self-hate.
Bring a plague to my pride.
Let me know: I am nothing.

Oh, there are no arms as big as Yours.
Oh, there are no arms as big as Yours.

Let us unite in the fact we are nothing.
Let us float into the dusk, united, united.

We are, we're gonna let it shine.
Let us shine.
We're gonna let it shine.
Let us shine.
Let me shine.
Let us shine.
We will shine.
