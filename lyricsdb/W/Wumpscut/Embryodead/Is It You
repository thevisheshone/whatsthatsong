Here in the dark
Is no light at all,
No orientation,
No shadows fall.

Here in the dark
I reach out for you,
Sensing fear.
Have I lost you?

Is it you?
Is it you?

I see no way out.
I just hear your voice.
It seems so dead, too cold for you,
Too cold for you to be alive.

I hesitate
To trust your voice.
Sounds so unreal,
It sounds like if somebody forces you.

Is it you?
Is it you?

My hand stretches out,
Now I feel your hand.
It is motionless.
Oh my god, it's dead!

The light is on now,
The Devil jeers at me.
He drags your corpse across barbed hooks
And takes away my soul with laughter.

Is it you?
Is it you?

Is it you?
Is it you?

Is it you?

Is it you?
