And suddenly there was war
We didn't remember it
A long time forgotten
There suddenly was war

And suddenly there was war
Our children are dead
Burnt in the ruins
That were left by war

War!
War!
War!
War!

War!
War!
War!
War!

And suddenly there was war
And the mothers, they screamed
For revenge and reprisals
For another war

And suddenly
And suddenly

And suddenly there was war
With spoiling and death
And you fight alone
If there's another war

Whole life is war
Your life is pain
And you will fight alone
In your personal war

War!
War!
War!
War!

This is war!

War!

War!
War!
War!
War!
