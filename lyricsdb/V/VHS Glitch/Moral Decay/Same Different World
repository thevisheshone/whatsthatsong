I'm in your world, expecting some love
Expecting some love
Expecting some...

I'm tired to see the blood on the floor
The blood on the floor
The blood on the...

Energy is low
I had no chance I had to kill 'em all
Kill 'em all yes, yeah.

Every bullet that I've shot
Was for every tear I dropped
My life is not like yours
It's the same different world.

Every bullet that I've shot
Was for every tear I dropped
My life is not like yours
We are on a same different world.

I know you think you live in the truth

That you're free to choose

Kill 'em all yes, yeah.

Every bullet that I've shot
Was for every tear I dropped
My life is not like yours
It's the same different world.

Every bullet that I've shot
Was for every tear I dropped
My life is not like yours
We are on a same different world.

Every bullet that I've shot
Was for every tear I dropped
My life is not like yours
It's the same different world.

Every bullet that I've shot
Was for every tear I dropped
My life is not like yours
We are on a same different world.

We are on a same different world...

We are on a same different world...
