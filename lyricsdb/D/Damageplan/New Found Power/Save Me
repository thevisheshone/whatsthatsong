"Save me from myself", I call out,
But no one hears my plea.
Burn my candle fast from both ends.
Nightmares grow from dreams.

You don't know, you can't see thrugh my eyes,
So you don't know me!
You don't know what's going through my mind,
But can you help me?

Save me from myself if you ever really cared.
Save me from myself, tell me you're not scared.

Intensity that grows within me,
Reflections of my pain.
I'll create or I'll destroy,
But either way it's always in my veins.

You don't know, you can't see through my eyes,
So you don't know me!
You don't know what's going through my mind,
But can you help me?

Save me from myself if you ever really cared.
Save me from myself, tell me you're not scared.

Save me from myself if you ever really cared.
Save me from myself, tell me you're not scared.

Save me from myself if you ever really cared.
Save me from myself, tell me you're not scared.

Save me from me
Save me from me
Save me from me
Save me from me

Save me from me
Save me
Save me
Save me from me
Save me
