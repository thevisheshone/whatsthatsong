Go!

Seems like only yesterday the dream became so clear.
All was possible and God, it felt so near!
So I suffered and I bled, I truly did believe.
Years have come and gone, but just where has it brought me?

In the blink of an eye
Seems like minutes as the years fly by.
In the blink of an eye
Afraid to stop because I can't stop time.

Strobing snapshots of my past become a blurring flash
Just one thing can make it all come flooding back

If I'd stopped just once to look back maybe I would see
Just how far I've come, but it took it's toll on me

In the blink of an eye
Seems like minutes as the years fly by.
In the blink of an eye
Afraid to stop because I can't stop time.

Blink of an eye!
Blink of an eye!
Blink of an eye!

That's just how fast your life can change.
In the blink of an eye, everything's erased.

In the blink of an eye
Seems like minutes as the years fly by.
In the blink of an eye
Afraid to stop because I can't stop time.

In the blink of an eye
Seems like minutes as the years fly by.
In the blink of an eye
Afraid to stop because I can't stop time.
