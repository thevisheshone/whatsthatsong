Yea!

I never saw whatever it was
That came and hit me from behind.
Then I awoke enraged and confused,
How could I have been so blind?

Life's escaping, don't pretend,
Judgement comes, but who knows when.

So when you least expect
That's when it takes effect,
A tragic twist to alter fate.
Instinct is to deny,
Logic does not apply.
In time we learn, but it's too late.

Blunt force trauma to the head!
Blunt force trauma to the head!

Blazing through life at the speed of sound.
Don't stop to look at the signs.
Suddenly everything crashes around you.
When we forget, life reminds.

Clock is running, falling sand,
Time is slipping through your hands.

So when you least expect
That's when it takes effect,
A tragic twist to alter fate.
Instinct is to deny,
Logic does not apply.
In time we learn, but it's too late.

Blunt force trauma to the head!

It's too late!
It's too late!
It's too late!
Too late!

Blunt force trauma.
Blunt force trauma.

So when you least expect
That's when it takes effect,
A tragic twist to alter fate.
Instinct is to deny,
Logic does not apply.
In time we learn, but it's too late.

Blunt force trauma to the head!

It's too late!
It's too late!
