There were times when I questioned my reasons.
Thought I wouldn't last.
Seemed the hand of God held my head underwater.
Somehow I fought back.

It's still not over yet.
No, it won't let me quit.

Found myself more than just once
Praying down on my knees.
My search for answers only led to more questions.
Sometimes for faith you've got to bleed.

By now I've bled my share,
Now it's my turn to redeem.

When it comes my way I won't be scared,
I've been waiting all my life.
Pain has prepared me for the moment of truth,
And the true test this time.

Give all you have because you believe,
Sell your mortal soul.
And if you're not a predator, then, oh - you better pray.
Bet it all now or fold.

But there's still a danger there.
Don't become one of them.

When it comes my way I won't be scared,
I've been waiting all my life.
Pain has prepared me for the moment of truth,
And the true test this time.

For all I've done - some good some bad,
Don't hang me just yet!
Judge me not on one thing I've done,
See my whole life instead!

When it comes my way, I won't be scared,
I've been waiting all my life.
Pain has prepared me for the moment of truth,
And the true test this time.
