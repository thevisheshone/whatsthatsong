You move like I want to
To see like your eyes do
We are downstairs
Where no one can see
New life break away

Tonight
I feel like more
Tonight I

You make the water warm
You taste foreign
And I know you can see
The cord break away
'Cause tonight
I feel like more

Tonight
I feel like more
Feel like more

Tonight
You breathed
Then you stopped
I breathed
Then dried you off

And tonight
I feel, feel like more
Tonight I feel like
Feel like more

Tonight I feel like more
Feel like more

Tonight
