One day
Meteorites will fall from the skies
And in their wake everything dies
The world around us will go its way
One day, one day

I'll wait, either way
I'll wait, either way

Bodies turn into dust
Buildings into rust
The land gives in to the sea

Life floats into space
Scattered without a trace
And all you can think about is me

I'll wait for you
(I'll wait, I'll wait for you)
Buildings come crashing down
Fire is all around
I'll wait, I'll wait for you

Keep your head held up high
I'll be somewhere in the shapes that twist the sky
I know soon we will reunite
Your embrace will surely keep us alive

C'est un été rouge
C'est un été rouge
C'est un été rouge
C'est un été rouge

(I'll wait for you)
C'est un été rouge
C'est un été rouge
(I'll wait for you)
C'est un été rouge
C'est un...

I'll wait for you
(I'll wait, I'll wait for you)
I'll wait for you
(I'll wait, I'll wait for you)

Buildings come crashing down
Fire is all around
I'll wait, I'll wait for you
Strolls on blackened ground
What's lost, will never be found
I'll wait, I'll wait
