Mind of destructive taste
I choose to stroll amongst the waste
That was your heart lost in the dark
Call off the chase

Walls of thought, strong and high
As my castle crumbles with time
I think of you, oh yes I do
Such a crime

You opened fire, and your mark was true
You opened fire, aim my smiling skull at you
You opened fire

I live tomorrow, you I'll not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow

Lines cut across my face
Why you laugh at my disgrace?
I'll never know how far to go
To reach that place

You opened fire, and your mark was true
You opened fire, aim my smiling skull at you
You opened fire

I live tomorrow, you I'll not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow

You opened fire, and your mark was true
You opened fire, aim my smiling skull at you
You opened fire

I live tomorrow, you I'll not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow

I live tomorrow, you I'll not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow

I live tomorrow, you I'll not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow

I live tomorrow, you I'll not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow
