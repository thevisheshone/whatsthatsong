Dead as dead can be
The doctor tells me
But I just can't believe him
Ever the optimistic one
I'm sure of your ability to become
My perfect enemy

Wake up
And face me
Don't play dead
'Cause maybe
Someday
I'll walk away and say
"You disappoint me"
Maybe you're better off this way

Leaning over you here
Cold and catatonic
I catch a brief reflection
What you could and might have been
It's your right and your ability
To become my perfect enemy

Wake up (why can't you)
And face me (come on now)
Don't play dead (don't play dead)
'Cause maybe (because maybe)
Someday (someday)
I'll walk away and say
"You disappoint me"
Maybe you're better off this way

Maybe you're better off this way
Maybe you're better off this way
Maybe you're better off this way
You're better off this
You're better off this
Maybe you're better off

Wake up (why can't you)
And face me (come on now)
Don't play dead (don't play dead)
'Cause maybe (because maybe)
Someday (someday)
I'll walk away and say
"You fucking disappoint me"
Maybe you're better off this way

Go ahead and play dead (go)
I know that you can hear this (go)
Go ahead and play dead (go)
Why can't you turn and face me
Why can't you turn and face me
Why can't you turn and face me
Why can't you turn and face me
You fucking disappoint me
