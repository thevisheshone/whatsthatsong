Metaphor for a missing moment
Pull me into your perfect circle

One womb
One shape
One resolve

Liberate this will
To release us all

Gotta cut away, clear away
Snip away and sever this
Umbilical residue
Keeping me from killing you

And from pulling you down with me in here
I can almost hear you scream

One more medicated peaceful moment
Give me
One more medicated peaceful moment

And I don't wanna feel this overwhelming
Hostility
I don't wanna feel this overwhelming
Hostility

Gotta cut away, clear away
Snip away and sever this
Umbilical residue

Gotta cut away, clear away
Snip away and sever this
Umbilical residue
Keeping me from killing you

Snip away and sever this

Keeping me from killing you
