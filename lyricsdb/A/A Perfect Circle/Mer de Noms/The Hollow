Run, desire, run
Sexual being
Running like a blade
To and through the heart, no conscience
One Motive: cater to the hollow

Screaming
"Feed me here, fill me up again"
Temporarily pacify this hunger
That's so cruel

Libido
Throw dominoes of indiscretions down
Falling all around in cycles,
In circles
Constantly consuming,
Conquer and devour

Cause it's time to bring the fire down
Bridle all this indiscretion
Long enough to edify
And permanently fill this hollow

Screaming
"Feed me here, fill me up again"
Temporarily pacifying

Feed me here, fill me up again
Temporarily pacifying
