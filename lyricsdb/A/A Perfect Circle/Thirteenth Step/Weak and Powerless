Tilling my own grave to keep me level
Jam another dragon down the hole
Digging to the rhythm and the echo of a solitary siren
One that pushes me along and leaves me so

Desperate and ravenous
I'm so weak and powerless
Over you

Someone feed the monkey while I dig in search of China
White as Dracula as I approach the bottom

Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Over you

Little angel, go away
Come again some other day
The Devil has my ear today
I'll never hear a word you say
He promised I would find a little solace
And some peace of mind
Whatever, just as long as I don't feel so

Desperate and ravenous
I'm so weak and powerless

Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Over you

Over you
