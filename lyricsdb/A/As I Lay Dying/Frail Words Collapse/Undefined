What is this world, what is it we've created
In the burdens of this life, I cannot rest
This world means nothing
Everything we hold will pass away

With a void of completion comfort will ever fade
I long for this wind to cease

Everything we hold will pass away
Everything we hold will pass away
I long for this wind to cease

We once held undying devotion;
Dead to our thoughts, undefined like our love

Everything we hold will pass away
Everything we hold will pass away
