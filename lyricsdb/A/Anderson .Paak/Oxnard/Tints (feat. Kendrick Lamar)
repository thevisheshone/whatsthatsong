I been feelin' kinda cooped up, cooped up
I'm tryin' to get some fresh air
Aye, why you got the roof off, roof off?
You know it never rains here
Aye, you ain't gotta flash when you takin' your picture
You ain’t gotta draw no extra attention
Paparazzi wanna shoot ya, shoot ya
Niggas dying for less, I hear

I been in my bag, adding weight
Tryin' to throw a bag in a safe
Giggin', tourin', chorin', raisin' babies
Baby Milo wants some Bathing Apes
Niggas cryin' for less out here
Do what I gotta do bruh, do bruh
Get up in my rear view mirror

I can't be ridin' round and round that open strip
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
I can’t be flyin' down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
And it’s no good for me, it's so good for them
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
I've got way too much to lose, so roll the window up real quick
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)

You probably think a nigga trollin'
Or showin' out for the cameras
Fuck I'm doin' fish-bowlin’?
One hundred thou' on the passenger
Bitch, I'm Kendrick Lamar, respect me from afar
I was made in his image, you call me a god
Everybody in attendance, I'm about to perform
Everybody get offended by the shit I got on
Like, can you buy that, nigga?
Now hundred horse, can you drive that, nigga?
A G5, can you fly that, nigga?
I need tints so I can look at the snakes and posers
(I need tint) 'Cause bomb head is non-disclosure
(I need tint) So I can live with a peace of mind
Without niggas takin' a piece of mine
And peace be still and I do fine, so fuck a fix-it ticket
You pull me over and might see one of your bitches

Ridin' round and round that open strip
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
I can’t be flyin' down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
And it’s no good for me, it's so good for them
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
I've got way too much to lose, so roll the window up real quick
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)

You know I like it presidential
Stretch it out, that's a limo
Pull it over, let me get behind you
Where we goin', they don't need to know
Ghost riding in a Phantom
Niggas never see me comin'
She wanna hold me like a ransom
But the money keep me runnin'

I been in my bag, adding weight
Tryin' to throw a bag in a safe
Giggin', tourin', chorin', raisin' babies
Baby Milo wants some Bathing Apes
Niggas cryin' for less out here
Do what I gotta do bruh, do bruh
Get up in my rear view mirror

Ridin' round and round that open strip
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
I can’t be flyin' down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
And it’s no good for me, it's so good for them
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
I've got way too much to lose, so roll the window up real quick
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)

I, I think I'm 'bout to black out
Can see me when I act out tonight
I got some moves I gotta make though
Who got the goons up on the payroll
They won't see me coming
They won't see me coming, no
I, I think I'm 'bout to black out
Can see me when I act out tonight
I got some moves I gotta make though
Who got the goons up on the payroll
They won't see me coming
They won't see me coming
