You were mine
Pretty flowers in the gardens of the town
Change or the sun won't shine
Change or the rain comes down

You were mine
But now it's the end of the in-between
Gone are the days
When the ammunition was clean

Change or the sun won't shine

Outside stories of misdemeanors grow
Seeing the blade in the rays
Running for cover they go, too late
How they come and how they fall
Baby cradle and all
Baby cradle and all

Close the door
Though it seems like we only kissed hello
It looks like it's time to go
It looks like it's time to go in the light
Somehow the craziness dissolves
Change or the sun won't shine (change or the sun won't shine)
Change or we end it all

Change or the sun won't shine

Change or the sun won't...
Change or the sun won't shine

Change or the sun won't...
Change or the sun won't shine

Change or the sun won't...
Change or the sun won't shine

Change or the sun won't...
Change or the sun won't shine

Change or the sun won't...
Change or the sun won't shine
