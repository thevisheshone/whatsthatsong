Cold and alone in the vinyard he lies
Stained and all broken the nightingale dies
Looking from your window, I can see the snow
Freezing cold

Cold and alone in the vinyard he lies
Stained and all broken the nightingale dies
Grinding to a halt on stone cold gravel
Freeze alone

Turning away from the wasted hours
Turning away from the wasted years
Turning away from the wasted hours
Turning away from the wasted years
