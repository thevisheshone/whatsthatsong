A startling sense of dislocation
Pushed away by voodoo crap
Spill your poison somewhere else
Can't shake the needles from your back

Guns and chains, emotional drains
Cutting it down to size
Captured by the Hindu curse
That holds your mesmerized

Slice my throat with stiletto knife
To keep my burning hope alive
The long black hair that smells like incense
Turns to vipers in my mind

Foul the pyramids with your presence
Holding in your tiny claws
The snakes that feed the witch with venom
Too late, no time to withdraw

Mambo witch
Mambo witch

Sounds of torture and moral exhaustion
Barely concealed by telephone wires

Heal the wounds, and lick the scars,
Screw your eyes to read those stars
She is fire, I am ice,
Bound to burn at any price

Mambo witch
Mambo witch

I want to kill you

Mambo witch
Mambo witch
Mambo witch
Mambo witch
