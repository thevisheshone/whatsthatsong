Break down, turn it around, hear the sound of laceration
The suffocating, devastating roaring of crowds
Dealing with the same vile people, same old bores
Get your head caught in revolving doors

Perfume, make-up -- it's a joke
Crucifixion, stiletto heels
Muscles and conversation -- it's a joke
Hatred forges nerve of steel

Choke the days and drown the nights
Choke the days and drown the nights
Choke the days and drown the nights
Choke the days and drown the nights

Taking off the city harness throw up in the kitchen sink
Cut while shaving, smashed the mirror,
Longing for another drink
Strange surroundings always drive me up the fire escape

Perfume, make-up -- it's a joke
Crucifixion, stiletto heels
Muscles and conversation -- it's a joke
Hatred forges nerve of steel

Choke the days and drown the nights
Choke the days and drown the nights
Choke the days and drown the nights
Choke the days and drown the nights

Perfume, make-up -- it's a joke
Crucifixion, stiletto heels
Muscles and conversation -- it's a joke
Hatred forges nerve of steel

Choke the days and drown the nights
Choke the days and drown the nights
Choke the days and drown the nights
Choke the days and drown the nights

Choke the days and drown the nights
Choke the days and drown the nights
Choke the days and drown the nights
Choke the days and drown the nights
