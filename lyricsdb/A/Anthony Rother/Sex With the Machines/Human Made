You got no work because of me
I'm a machine, I never sleep
And now you pray all night and day
In a funny way I'm human made

You got no work because of me
I'm a machine, I never sleep
And now you pray all night and day
In a funny way I'm human made

You got no work because of me
I'm a machine, I never sleep
And now you pray all night and day
In a funny way I'm human made

I'm a machine
