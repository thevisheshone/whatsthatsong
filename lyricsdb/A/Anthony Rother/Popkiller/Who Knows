Once there's a moment, a moment in your life,
A moment of about the future, a moment for about a time.
Once you're there...
No point of return, no point of return.

Who does know where we are going?
Don't hold back the tears.
Don't hold back the tears,
Because it shows your life.

Once there's a moment, a moment in your life,
A moment of about the future, a moment for about a time.
Once you're there...
No point of return, no point of return.

Who does know where we are going?
Don't hold back the tears.
Don't hold back the tears,
Because it shows your life.

Who does know where we are going?
Don't hold back the tears.
Don't hold back the tears,
Because it shows your life.

Once there's a moment...
