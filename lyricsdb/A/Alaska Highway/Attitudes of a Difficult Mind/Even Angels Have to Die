Even angels have to die
With their ascension buried deeper
Our world, in time, shall become a grave
Inside there will be dirt instead of feelings

All our hearts must learn to break
For nothing beautiful lasts forever
The longing of what's lost shall never fade
A void is left and we feel so empty

Even angels have to die
No love on earth can restrain its ending
Sadness waits to claim our fall
And mourn for love that seeks its savior

Darkness finds me in my fate
The beautiful face which may bring salvation
Souls embrace a shattering wound
Have I strength to admit my desperation?

Please save me from apathy
That drains my sympathy
Just speak those words that need to be
You can't promise to never die

Even angels have to die
But love is worth the tears that it brings me
I'll bleed with you 'til I am drained
Though my color may be less than perfect

Could the intent be to invade
This place where nothing dreams eternal?
Fear that you'll be torn away
Had lead me to my own decay

This thought of wasting haunts my mind
For my heart can't lose another angel

Please save me from apathy
That drains my sympathy
Just speak those words that need to be
You can't promise to never die

Save me from apathy
That drains my sympathy
Just speak those words that need to be
You can't promise to never die
