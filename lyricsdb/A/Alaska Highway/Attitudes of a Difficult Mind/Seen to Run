Dressed in rags,
Plastic bags.
I recognise you,
I know you from before.

Like slugs on their way
Across the deadly tar,
Going for your dreams
Won't get you very far.

And is it true?
Do saints have to end up like you?
She called you a liar,
You dropped the hair dryer into the water.

I thought we'd see
That sinners end up harmless like me.
Running out of things to say,
Running out of grounds to get up every day.

The trick is to keep lying,
Put on your brightest smile.
Run towards the train,
Play your final game.

The trick is to keep lying,
Put on your brightest smile.
Run towards the train,
Play your final game.

I feel sleepy,
This is creepy.
My hands are numb.
Pile the bottles up.

In Babylon you smile,
In Babylon you never reach the top.

Is it true?
Do saints have to end up like you?
She called you a liar,
You dropped the hair dryer into the water.

I thought we'd see
That sinners end up harmless like me.
Running out of things to say,
Running out of grounds to get up every day.

(The trick is to keep lying)
Is it true?
(Put on your brightest smile)
(Run towards the train)
Do saints have to end up like you?
(Play your final game)

(The trick is to keep lying)
She called you a liar,
(Put on your brightest smile)
You dropped the hair dryer
(Run towards the train)
(Play your final game)
Into the water.

(The trick is to keep lying)
I thought we'd see
(Put on your brightest smile)
(Run towards the train)
That sinners end up harmless like me.
(Play your final game)
(The trick is to keep lying)
Running out of things to say,
(Put on your brightest smile)
Running out of grounds to get up every day.
(Run towards the train)
(Play your final game)

(Play your final game)
