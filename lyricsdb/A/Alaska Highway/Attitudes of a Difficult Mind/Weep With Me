(Weep with me)
(Weep with me)

The sea will devour both you and me,
But not before I hold you one last time.
Love was my only defeat
In this city built on lies.

Weep with me before I abandon thee
(Weep with me)
And distract my view with images to erase you.
(Weep with me)
Weep with me in the depths of my reality
(just weep with me)
And reveal the pain that once was beauty.

(Sadness sleeps with me tonight)
(Sadness sleeps with me tonight)

Sadness sleeps with me tonight,
My heaven had failed me again.
(Heaven is dark)
Deep, all these cuts
(Bleeding, I'm bleeding)
That bleed from love.

Weep with me before I abandon thee
(Weep with me)
And distract my view with images to erase you.
(Weep with me)
Weep with me in the depths of my reality
(Weep with me)
And reveal the pain that once was beauty.

Was it your intent to hurt me?
Let me waste away, desert me?
Was it your hope to break me?
Let me perish, devastate me?

Weep with me before I abandon thee
(Weep with me)
And distract my view with images to erase you.
(Weep with me)
Weep with me in the depths of my reality
(Weep with me)
And reveal the pain that once was beauty.

(Weep with me, my beauty)
(Just weep with me)
(Sleep with sadness, tonight)
(Weep with me)
(Just weep with me)
