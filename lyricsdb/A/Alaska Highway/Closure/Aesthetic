Seeking winter I have found,
Something colder in my heart.
Hope depleting as I pass,
That which falls to pretend.
Never effort to offend,
But to restrain these dreams I'm having.

I can slip away right now,
Take these thoughts upon myself.
And like the world, I may end
For there is nothing to defend.
Press my face against the wall,
Hide my eyes so you can't see
All the damage that you've done to me.

Palest rain that touched my face
As I ran towards a cruel illusion.
Hold this fragile thought in vain,
Tough that future will not save us.
Sleeping hell that wakes for me.

I can slip away right now,
Take these thoughts upon myself.
And like the world, I may end
For there is nothing to defend.
Press my face against the wall,
Hide my eyes so you can't see
All the damage that you've done to me.

All the damage that you've done to me.

I can slip away right now,
Take these thoughts upon myself.
And like the world, I may end
For there is nothing to defend.
Press my face against the wall,
Hide my eyes so you can't see
All the damage that you've done to me.

I can slip away right now,
Take these thoughts upon myself.
And like the world, I may end
For there is nothing to defend.
Press my face against the wall,
Hide my eyes so you can't see
All the damage that you've done to me.
