Why do you hide your eyes from me?
There is no shame in empathy

I'm not perfect, there's no explanation.
I've not come for complication.

Stakes are made so that we learn,
Not stains that lead our souls to burn.

Why do you feel this way?

Have I failed you,
Have I lead you astray?
Have you invited darkness to your side?
No matter how you've tried to hide,
I see and love you as you are.

Why do you run from sadness?
It comes from someplace good.
If you've never truly loved,
Then you've never truly hurt.
Does that make make you feel weak?
And have I crossed that line?

Have I failed you,
Have I lead you astray?
Have you invited darkness to your side?
No matter how you've tried to hide,
I see and love you as you are.

Do not hide your face from me,
Tears are a sign of God's mercy.
As you cry, so does he.
I love you as you are...
