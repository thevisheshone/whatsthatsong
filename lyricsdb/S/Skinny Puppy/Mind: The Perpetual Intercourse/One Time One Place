Metal rain collapse
Crawls out
Which way the will go
Harness to ever last

Wallowing to test the past
A truth
At times so shallow
Develop an attitude

More time
Decay, lapse in
Fortify thyself, cut off
Inbred and forever more

What a way to end the game

Failing, bleeding eyes
Caricature of pain
Distant, so distant
Melting in the rain

Cold war
Flies forth
On wings of destruction
An orgy of missile tests

A mortifying flash
Huddled
Round the radio-active
Console to control

The lives of the young
Levels of toxic waste
Disgrace
Yet tolerant

Of all that's been done
Built up for a future race
A race
That's never won

Falling from on high
Meet the maker's face
Distort, forget time
Forever leave this place

An atom fuse
Shortens
With man's progression
Decipher what's relative

A legal bureaucrat
Motions with a tender finger
Who's poverties
And who's will be next

Man in a cave
Further action left at that
Two gaping holes
A dripping carnivore

Nature's regret
The law of things so brutalized
An enemy
That need not

What a way to end the game

Third world
Make peace
A visionary
Repress the weak, repress the weak, repress the weak, repress the weak, repress, repress

That's all there is

A hint of gleam
A halo of old jaded weakness
Corruption
Runs harmonious

Taken by extremes
Doorway
Extinction pleases
Repression is based on love

For all length of time
Full of elemental powers
Inbred and not brilliant
No fortune could buy this
