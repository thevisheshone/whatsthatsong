Is this pure reality?
Could we be led to believe?
Lemmings up against a sea
Drowning in speculation

Even told when waters older
More polluted never
Drink the murky media
To plumb the depth of time

Anyone
Anyone
Anyone
Anyone

What of human frailty
Visualize with clarity?
Past the sanitation
To the childish flesh and bone

Bleaching sticks and stoner ribs
Pukes up the gallow's laughter
Stage the mighty media
Blessing this sanitation

What is this supposed to hold?
Freedoms crush, disparaged souls?
Despot dug in yellow cake
And failed to certify it

Crippled son to pass it on
A hatred fed on hatred
Redefy defensive form
As if to never see that

What is real?
Canned I feel,
Less important than today
Anyway, is it worth the slaughter?

Sit and feel absolutely zero suffering
A condition worth denying

Pasted carcass, killing fields
Body parts off dolls that bleed
Who was once committed
Pulling wings off flying things

Feeling bold to knot put over
Twisted ever after
Hissing faded left alone
To replicate the lie

What is real?
Ask the dream
Some dim shift, a rift within
Funniest seems a distant damp ring

Fitting end
Destination: ego
Death within
The condition: dear dementia
