Life is but a dream
Drifting on a stream, a stream
Consciously it seems
All of what remains

Ego brain
Man-made shame
Shame
Love after it rains

You see my pain is real
Watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the fall
As I turn to sand
You took me by the hand
And declared that love prevails over all

I am just a man
Fighting other men
For land, for land
While I turn to sand
In spite of the pain

Ego brain
Man-made shame
Shame, love after it rains

You see my pain is real
Watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the fall
As I turn to sand
You took me by the hand
And declared that love prevails over all

All of what remains
Ego brain
Man-made shame
Shame, love after it rains

You see my pain is real
Watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the fall
As I turn to sand
You took me by the hand
And declared that love prevails over all

Love after it rains...
