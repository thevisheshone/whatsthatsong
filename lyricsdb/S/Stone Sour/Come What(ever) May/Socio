I remember now, but I still have my doubts
I think it's gonna be today
Everybody came, but it's just not the same
Why did it have to be today?

Now my chest is tight
No, I am not all right
It doesn't have to be this way
Why does it have to be this way?

I don't know what's wrong,
It's like I'm too far gone
It doesn't matter anyway
Fear is in my heart, just when I stop, it starts
And I can never live this way

Freedom in a cage, no sun and too much rage
I don't know how much I can take
Push it down inside, but it know just where I hide
I know that "normal" is hard to fake
Bleeding into life, it's like a thousand knives
Are slowly turning me to this
Why does it have to be like this?

I don't know what's wrong,
It's like I'm too far gone
It doesn't matter anyway
Fear is in my heart, just when I stop, it starts
And I can never live this way

I don't know what's wrong,
It's like I'm too far gone
It doesn't matter anyway
Fear is in my heart, just when I stop, it starts
And I can never live this way

I lost again today
I lost again,
I lost again today
I lost again,
I lost again today

I don't know what's wrong,
It's like I'm too far gone
It doesn't matter anyway
Fear is in my heart, just when I stop, it starts
And I can never live this way

Living with a curse, sometimes it's even worse
It slowly kills me everyday
Something I despise is gonna take my life
I guess I'll try again today
