Reveal to me this ugly thing,
I'm rusted metal by your head
It's gotten out of hand again,
Nobody sees it, but I can

You thought of everything, I bet,
But did you think that I might die?
I haven't really smiled in
I don't know know how long, you know
Something's gonna give again,
Something's gonna give again

I tried to fight, but did you listen?
Even after you're gone, man, I'm finished
I could never be you god,
But then I don't even think I want the job anymore

Say something, anything to me
I do believe, but I have doubts
So many reasons to hold on,
Conflicting interest isn't it

I guess I'm better off in the end,
'Cause you were always there to blame
I haven't felt so bad in
I don't know how long, you know
I can't get away again,
I can't get away again

I tried to fight, but did you listen?
Even after you're gone, man, I'm finished
I could never be your god,
But then I don't even think I want the job, you see

I tried to fight, but did you listen?
Even after you're gone, man, I'm finished
I could never be your god,
But then I don't even think I want the job anymore

What am I supposed to do now?
How am I supposed to live now?
All I ever did was try,
But the story ends,
So I guess I'll have to die

Where am I supposed to go now?

Go ahead and go away
Go ahead and go away
Go ahead and go away
Go ahead and go away

Go away

What am I supposed to do now?
How am I supposed to live now?
All I ever did was try,
But the story ends,
So I guess I'll have to die

What am I supposed to do now?
How am I supposed to live now?
What am I supposed to do now?
How am I supposed to live now?

How am I supposed to live?
How am I supposed to live?
How am I supposed to live?
How am I supposed to?
