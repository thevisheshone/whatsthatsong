Well where does it say
All the love that we made must disappear?
And who made the rule
That the one who is cruel won't cry the tears?

Well we woke up unsatisfied,
Got out of bed and said goodbye
But don't leave me here
Dying on the cross of love

Whoa...

Don't leave me here
Dying on the cross of love
I got down on my knees
And prayed to the lord above

Don't leave me now, baby realize
You can't make our love a sacrifice
Don't leave me here
Dying on the cross of love

Who pays the cost
If the love that is lost goes unredeemed?
And why should I care
If this cross that I bear is destiny?

My heart was pure, my love was strong
Forgive me if I've done you wrong
Don't leave me here
Dying on the cross of love

Whoa...

Don't leave me here
Dying on the cross of love
I got down on my knees
And prayed to the lord above, oh-whoa

Don't leave me now, baby realize
You can't make our love a sacrifice
Don't leave me here
Dying on the cross of love

Whoa...

Where does it say
All the love that we made must disappear?
Who made the rule
That the one who is cruel won't cry the tears?

Well, now I know how cruel thou art
Have mercy baby on my heart
Don't leave me here
Dying on the cross of love

Whoa...

Don't leave me here
Dying on the cross of love
I got down on my knees
And prayed to the lord above, oh-whoa

Don't leave me now, baby realize
You can't make our love a sacrifice
Don't leave me here
Dying on the cross of love

But don't you leave me here
Dying on the cross of love

But don't you leave me here
Dying on the cross of love
