The wind is blowing beer cans
Down a cold, deserted street
I feel as empty as those beer cans
Rolling past my feet

I can hear Chicago blues
From an out of tune guitar
And a "1939" neon sign
Buzzing above the bar

I'm at an intersection, lost my direction
And I don't know which way to go
She left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love
Left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love

Left me on the corner of Lust and Love
She left me on the corner of Lust and Love

I got an old tattoo dedicated to you
Covered up with thorns
But the heart bleeds through and your name does, too
Forever on my arm

Each night I go walking
Through the darkness all alone
But I never get off that dirty old street
No matter how far I roam

Intersection, lost my direction
And I don't know which way to go
She left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love
Left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love

Left me on the corner of Lust and Love
She left me on the corner of Lust and Love

Underneath the street lights
I strain my eyes to see
The silhouette's reflection
Of a long black Mercury

Shadows on the pavement
From the corners of my eye
Fool me into thinking
My baby's passing by

Intersection, lost my direction
And I don't know which way to go
She left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love
You're the only one I've been thinking of
Left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love
Left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love...

She left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love
Left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love

Yeah!
Oh!
Uh!

Left me on the corner of Lust 'n' Love
