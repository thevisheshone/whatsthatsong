And when you go away
Don't let the red glow burn my eyes
And if you make me pay
To keep you, name your price

And I'm just waiting
I'm waiting
And I'm just waiting

You think you miss me
I always made you smile
I feel the rope start to burn
But the victory will be mine

And I'm just waiting
I'm just waiting
I'm waiting
Just waiting

And I'm just waiting
Just waiting

And I'm just waiting
I'm waiting

Waiting
I'm just waiting

And I'm just waiting

I'm waiting
Just waiting
Just waiting

And I'm just waiting
Just waiting

I'm waiting

I'm just waiting
