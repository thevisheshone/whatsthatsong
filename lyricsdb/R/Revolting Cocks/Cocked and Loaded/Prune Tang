Hey kids
Prune tang's here
Oh, yeah!
She's all damn rich
Knows where to scratch me when I itch
She's a wrinkled little bitch
She sucks the chrome right off my trailer hitch

Prune tang!
(Prune tang)

When she goes awry
You find out quick there's no other way
She's a one stop shop
She's always open and ready to rock

My-my-my-my prune tang!
My-my-my (prune tang)

My-my-my-my prune tang!
My-my-my (prune tang)

Miles and miles of duct tape
Couldn't match up my day
Nothing in this world but sweet prune tang
Could ever make me feel this way

My-my, my-my-my-my-my
Prune tang on my mind
My-my, my-my-my-my-my
Prune tang all the time

My-my-my-my prune tang
My-my-my (prune tang)

(Prune tang)
Prune tang!
(Prune tang)
Prune tang!
(Prune tang)
