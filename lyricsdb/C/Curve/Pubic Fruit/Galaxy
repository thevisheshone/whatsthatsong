Won't say no...

He's got sugar on his lips
And he knows that the sickness is his
And he shows it
He just shows it

He'll give you the remedy
Without the chemical,
Show you the picture
Without the scenery

All he wants is
A blow by blow by blow account
Always searching for the real thing
Scratching the surface, getting nowhere

My place has been stolen,
Invaded by sharks
Covered in glitter
As shiny as glass

The pavement is soft and sweet
The galaxy is so elite

It won't say no
It won't say yes
It won't say no
It won't say yes

Crush me with your ice pick
I am the queen
I've come to take the sweetness
And keep you down in my cave

Keep you down in my cave...

The pavement is soft and sweet
The universe is so elite

It won't say no
It won't say yes
It won't say no
It won't say yes

It won't say no (everybody knows)
It won't say yes (I see it in your eyes)
It won't say no (everybody knows)
It won't say yes (I see it in your eyes)
