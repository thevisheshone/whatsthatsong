Respire my desire
Lean on me
Fall on me
Respond
And it will be

'cuz I am waiting
For the stars to change
So we will talk again

I'm impatient
For the sun to change
So we can meet again

He was well spoken
And unconnected
Caught his tongue
It became infected
Ce couldn't breathe
Venom into the heart
Of an issue
He could stare right at you
And never see you
He could crush faith
He could crush minds
He's a cynic
And he loves it
He believe in it
It's more than a man
Could ever want

In his own image
In his being

Like this leather glove
Could be
Could be
Could be

I'm impatient
For the sun to go down
'cuz I am waiting
For the stars to change
