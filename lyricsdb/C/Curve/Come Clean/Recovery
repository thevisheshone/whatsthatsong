The months go by
And I don't think of you
The signal is frail
An imprint of what you do

So I turn up the sound
And you are nowhere
I have learnt this
To my cost

But I maintain
In the slow lane
I maintain
In the slow lane

The scent goes by
Still I smell of you
You say I cry
At the merest thought of you

So you let me down
To laugh at nothing
I have learnt this
For myself

But I maintain
In the slow lane
I maintain
In the slow lane

So I turn down the sound
And you are nowhere
I have learnt this
To my cost

But I maintain
In the slow lane
But I maintain
In the slow lane
I maintain
In the slow lane

So turn down the sound
'Cuz you're nowhere
You let me down
To laugh at nothing

I have learnt this
To my cost
I have learnt this
For myself

I have learnt this
To my cost
I have learnt this
For myself

I have learnt this
To my cost
I have learnt this
For myself

I have learnt this
To my cost
I have learnt this
For myself
