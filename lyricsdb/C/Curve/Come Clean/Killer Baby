I'll put you down as the third alternative
When you get to the bottom of the list.
In the call for sanity nothing breathes.
So I'll put you up as a friend of Mary's,
'Cause when she's raring to go she's quite contrary.

In the race for courage everyone's gone blind.

You're doing real well now,
Killer now baby
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer, killer, killer, killer, killer, killer.

Happy in a manic sort of way
But I'm real on a manic high day
'Til the universe has left us all behind

You're doing real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer now baby,
Real well now,
Killer, killer, killer, killer, killer, killer.

I can't let go of the past,
When it's my future that's safe and rosy,
I can't step out onto the streets,
When it's my moods that keep me broody.

Throw it out and see what happens
Throw it out and see what happens
Throw it out and see what happens
Throw it out and see what happens

Throw it out and see what happens
Throw it out and see what happens
Throw it out and see what happens
Throw it out and see what happens

Throw it out and see what happens
Throw it out and see what happens
