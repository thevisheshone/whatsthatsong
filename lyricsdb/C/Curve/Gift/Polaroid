You're too good for me,
I don't feel worthy.
I've told you this before,
You've always known the score.

'Cause only you can give me,
The reassurance that I need.

I've told myself,
Though it don't seem to help,
Told myself,
Though it don't seem to help,

'Cause only you can show me.

Can you see me?
For the shadow that I am.
Do you believe me?
When I'm as shallow as I am.

I'm waiting patiently,
For the Polaroid to take hold.
Then all my secrets,
They will unfold.

I only wanted someone,
To lift me from despair.
When I turn a corner,
I'd like you to be waiting there.

'Cause only you can teach me,
The resources that I need.
I hold myself,
Though it don't seem to help.
Hold myself,
Though it don't seem to help,

'Cause only you can show me.

Can you see me?
For the shadow that I am.
Do you believe me?
When I'm as shallow as I am.

I'm waiting patiently,
For the Polaroid to take hold.
Then all my secrets,
They will unfold.
