Are we savages,
Born without hope
Last on these highways,
Existing to go?

Swallowed my pride,
Gutted me from the inside,
Left me in this pool of doubt,
Now I don't think I can get out.

But you can laugh,
You can laugh,
You can laugh,
'Cause you think that you're better than me.

If we are the instigators
Of our times,
Why do we harmonize,
Then revolutionize our crimes?

Down in this sandpit
Of misbegotten youth
We can show them the songs,
The one truth.

But you can laugh,
You can laugh,
You can laugh,
'Cause you think that you're better than,
You think that you're better than everyone.

I'm just trying to do the right thing.
I'm just trying to do the right thing.
The right thing.

Escape to my eyes
Escape to my eyes

Escape to my eyes
Escape to my eyes
