I'm sick of you my sickly friend
I used to think on you I could depend
Now I know to my power
The truth of it, the day and the hour

You can trust me, you can trust me
I'm your ally, I'm your alibi
I'm rid of you my tricky friend
There was a time when you and I could pretend
But now I know to my shame
that there's no reason there's no blame

You don't know your destiny yet
You're too wrapped up in what you think
That's all you want to hear
That's all you want to share

'Cuz you don't know your destiny yet
You're too wrapped up in what you think
That's all you want to hear
That's all you want to share

'Cuz you don't know your destiny yet
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
You're too wrapped up in what you think
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I'm sick of you my sickly friend
I used to think on you I could depend
But now I know to my power
The truth of it, the day and the hour

You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know

You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)

You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know

You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know

You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know

You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)

You can trust me...
You can trust me
You can trust me...
You can trust me
