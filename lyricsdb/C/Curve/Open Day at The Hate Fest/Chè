You want to hurt me
To make me feel what you feel
You want to tear me
Till I bleed at the seam

You're so sick of what you live under
You take it to extremes
So sick of what you waste
That you can't even dream

I'm not your slave
You're not my master
But I know it's the picture
Your after

I'm not your slave
You're not my master
But I know it's the picture
Your after

You want to trap me
Like a fly on the wall
Then you call me useless
For finding the cause

You're so tired of all you left hidden
It falls into obscene
So tired of all the haste
And what you could've been

I'm not your slave
You're not my master
But I know it's the picture
You're after

I'm not your slave
You're not my master
But I know it's the picture
You're after

This is all I need to know

This is all I need to know

I'm not your slave
You're not my master
But I know it's the picture
You're after

I'm not your slave
You're not my master
But I know it's the picture
You're after

You're so sick of what you live under
You take it to extremes
So sick of what you waste
That you can't even dream

You're so tired of all you left hidden
It falls into obscene
So tired of all the haste
And what you could've been

What you could've been...

What you could've been...

Falls into obscene...

Falls into obscene...
