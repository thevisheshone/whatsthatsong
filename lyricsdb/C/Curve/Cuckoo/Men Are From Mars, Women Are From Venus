Turn it up, turn it down
Switch it on, switch it off
Called a friend, threw the phone
Cut me down, I'm lost

I retire, you resign
I win, you lose

Break it up, break it down

Men are from Mars
Women are from Venus
Men are from Mars
Women are from Venus
Women are from Venus

Show me up, drag you round
I smile, you frown
Never have I known
Such a liar, such a liar, such a liar

Men are from Mars
Women are from Venus
Men are from Mars
Women are from Venus
Women are from Venus

And we won't be happy
Till we kill each other
We won't be happy
Till we kill each other
We won't be happy
Till we kill each other

Men are from Mars
Men are from Mars
Men are from Mars
Men are from Mars
Men are from Mars
Men are from Mars

Never-ending stories
Will be our greatest glory
Children will believe us
'cause they know that we will teach trust

The point to living freely
Is to hope that we'll see clearly
And manage information
For the next generation

It's the never-ending stories
That will be our greatest glory
And our children will believe us
Because they know that we will teach trust

The point to living freely
Is to hope that we'll see clearly
