Feeling the fire
Under my feet
I was a liar
You were a cheat

Playing with knives
We were cut close to home
Close to the bone
You're so alone

Something to have
Something to hold
Something to share
So I've been told

Deep in your eyes
You're one hundred years old
'Cause the years have not been
Kind to you, you know

Heal it up
Heal it up
Heal me up
Heal me up
Heal me up

Feeling the pinch
Feeling the hole
Feeling the void
Deep in my soul

Feeling my
Feelings so out of control
'Cause the years have not been
Kind to me, I know

Heal it up
Heal it up
Heal it up
Heal it up

Heal it up
Heal it up
Heal it up
Heal me up
Heal me...
