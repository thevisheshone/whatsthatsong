Well, I hear you're driving someone else's car now
She said you came and took your stuff away
All the poetry and the trunk you kept your life in
I knew that it would come to that someday

Like a sad hallucination
When I opened up my eyes
The train had passed the station
And you were trapped inside
Yet I never wonder where you went
I only wonder why, I wonder why

Oh, Caroline (Caroline)
Oh-oh-oh, Caroline (Caroline)
Oh, oh, Caroline (Caroline)
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Caroline (Caroline)

Well, I hear you're using someone else's number
She said she saw you in the store today
It doesn't matter whose address you're listed under
I only know they'll never make you stay

Like a memory in motion
You were only passing through
That is all you've ever known of life
That's all you'll ever do
There's a dream I have where I sail away
Looking back I wave at you, and I wave goodbye

Oh, Caroline (Caroline)
Oh-oh-oh, Caroline (Caroline)
Oh, oh, Caroline (Caroline)
Oh, Caroline (Caroline)

In another life I see you as an angel flying high
And the hands of time will free you
You will cast your chains aside
And the dawn will come and kiss away
Every tear that's ever fallen from your eyes

Behind those eyes I wonder

(Caroline)
Oh, Caroline (Caroline)
Oh-oh-uh-oh (Caroline)
Whoa (Caroline)
Oh-oh-oh, Caroline (Caroline)
Sometimes I wonder (Caroline)
Oh, oh. Caroline (Caroline)
Sometimes I, sometimes I wonder (Caroline)
(Caroline)
Oh-oh-oh, Caroline (Caroline)
Whoa, Caroline (Caroline)
