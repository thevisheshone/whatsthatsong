You drag me down
It's safe to say
I don't know you
Or what's to blame
Another night
Of losing sleep
Point the finger
Silent dreams

Poison the mind
Poison the mind
It's killing time
It's killing time

You take me down
Below the streets
Another talk
Beneath the sheets
So come out and play
Before losing sleep
Something's lost
We're in too deep

Poison the mind
Poison the mind
It's killing time
It's killing time

Poison the mind
Poison the mind
Poison the mind
Poison the mind
Poison the mind
Poison the mind
It's killing time
It's killing time
