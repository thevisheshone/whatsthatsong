(Be-beep)

When I get mad and I get pissed
I grab my pen and I write out a list
Of all the people that won't be missed
You've made my shitlist

For all the ones who bum me out (shitlist)
For all the ones who fill my head with doubt (shitlist)
For all the squares who get me pissed (shitlist)
You've made my shitlist

Shitlist
Shitlist

When I get mad and I get pissed (shitlist)
I grab my pen and write out a list (shitlist)
Of all you assholes who won't be missed (shitlist)
You've made my shitlist

Shitlist
Shitlist

Shitlist
Shitlist
