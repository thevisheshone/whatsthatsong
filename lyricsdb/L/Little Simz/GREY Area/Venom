Life sucks and I never tried suicide
Minds fucked even more than I realise
Times up keep it moving when she arrives
If you ever heard what I heard in my mind
Never try
You would cry
Thats a lie
You would die
I don’t ever wanna come down from a high
Im in the best seat
From time been a next breed
If your coming come at me directly
Don’t need no-one to defend me
Souls in a place even I can’t get to
Don’t fuck with the deadly
Moon waves and open seas
Quick coasting over seas
Fuck those who don’t believe
They will never wanna admit I’m the best here
For the mere fact that I’ve got ovaries
Its a woman world so to speak
Pussy you sour
Never giving credit where its due cos you don’t like pussy in power

My my if you ever heard what I heard in the night
What a fright
Must’ve been a parasite in my past life
I don’t ever wanna come down from a high
My soul ascended to the sky
Its just you and I
Gone but I’m feeling too alive
Tryna get me outta spite
Someones gotta pay I ain’t talking big amounts
Some kinda physical pain
Some kinda traumatic shit
Niggas wanna see dead bodies probably not they ain’t rolling with no automatic clips
Moving scatty all erratic and shit
Niggas pussy licking batty and shit
Oh you mad? Then come at me you prick
Make a move better pattern it quick
I assume you’ll be coming for blood
That makes 2 of us that makes 2 of us

Night time to daylight we roll trees
Saves live invade minds and go deep
Oh he wouldn’t of guessed I’m so chill
Part of the day in the life you won’t see
Part of the day in the life you can’t be here for
Its the day in the life of OG’s
Dealing with inner demons that won’t leave
No a word you will listen when my soul speaks
Down I go
So follow me follow me follow me
Actually don’t follow me
Nobody bother me
Im a mess honestly
Fuck all your policies
They wanna kick me down a demolish me
Use me and fucking abolish me
I don’t wanna hear no apologies
Or am I in my own head?
Can’t tell anymore psychotic to the death
When I dig deep I can never find nothing left
Its a mystery
Rage
Nothing but rage
Can’t figure out if I’m going insane
Aint’ no doubt we’ll be showing no mercy so think twice if you wanna get blazed
Nothing ain’t nice round here no games
I don’t wanna dark nobody in a flash
True its a stick up
Hands in the air
Put the money in bag all cash all cash
