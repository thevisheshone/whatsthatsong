We are born into a world,
Where intelligence is slaved to money
We've accepted our thoughtlessness
Not to see our imperfection
We want more and more and more
We populate the Earth like cancer
We see all that, grin and bear it
But can't stop killing

Welcome to the world
Our egos shine like silver
And when we're gone
The Earth will take a breath

Welcome to the world
Our egos shine like silver
And when we're gone
The Earth will take a breath

Dusty ruins - witnesses of our past
Our eyes look back through a veil of ashes
How will our future look?
Radioactive landscapes?
Mutated beings crawling on our way?
Where are we going?
Where is the escape?

Welcome to the world
Our egos shine like silver
And when we're gone
The Earth will take a breath

Welcome to the world
Our egos shine like silver
And when we're gone
The Earth will take a breath

Welcome to the world
Our egos shine like silver
And when we're gone
The Earth will take a breath

Welcome to the world
Our egos shine like silver
And when we're gone
The Earth will take a breath

Welcome to the world
Our egos shine like silver
And when we're gone
The Earth will take a breath

Welcome to the world
Our egos shine like silver
And when we're gone
The Earth will take a breath
