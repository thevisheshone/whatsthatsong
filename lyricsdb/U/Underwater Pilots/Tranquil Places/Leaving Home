Wasn't it a tranquil place I left?
I am trustful.
For nothing I can grip with my hands,
But for a new chance.

Wasn't it the false friends I believed in,
I spent my time for?
I always waited for affection,
For some friendly words.

Will I have the courage to stand with empty hands?
Will I have the courage to do what life demands?

Will I have the courage to stand with empty hands?
Will I have the courage to do what life demands?

How many disappointments can I stand
Before I resignate?
When things that once were charming
Get an ugly face.

Can I keep my favourite things alive,
The places I like the most?
I won't be careless with myself,
I will protect my dreams.

Will I have the courage to stand with empty hands?
Will I have the courage to do what life demands?

Will I have the courage to stand with empty hands?
Will I have the courage to do what life demands?

Will I have the courage to stand with empty hands?
Will I have the courage to do what life demands?

Will I have the courage to stand with empty hands?
Will I have the courage to do what life demands?
